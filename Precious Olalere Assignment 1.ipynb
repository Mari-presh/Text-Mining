    "In terms of any other observations, the dataset seems to be textual data about political campaigns, perhaps speech given during a political campaign by different parties. The dataset appears to have some missing values in some columns, with a large portion missing items coming from the context and location column. Due to the fact that majority of the sentences do not have a quoted content, there is also about 9843 missing items from the new column that I created after I extracted the quoted content from the statement column.\n",

    "As I progressed with different preprocessing processes, I realized that the meaning of each statement started to change, and it changed drastically after I performed stop words remover and stemming. These two processes literally changed the text. For example, the stop word remover extracted only useful information from the text and performing stemming reduced the plain text words to their root word\n",
