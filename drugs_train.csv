I was prescribed Zantac regularly (1-2x daily) for acid reflux. I developed notably worsened anxiety and nocturnal panic attacks where I would wake up almost every night 2-3 hours after falling asleep with episodes of vivid nonsensical dream-like episodes lasting 2-3 hours. I would have a hard time figuring out simple things like how to open my door or plug in my phone charger to call home. I would keep parents on the phone for 2-3 hours asking them to come get me for no reason even when I had work the next morning. I was constantly confused and dizzy even during the day and it began significantly affecting my work performance. I did research on my own and found out Zantac can cause all the above. I contacted my psychiatrist, who did not know I was on Zantac and they told me Zantac can do this and has had several patients experience this. Since I stopped taking Zantac I have slept full nights with no episodes &amp; minimal to no anxiety. I have never had any experience like this prior to being on Zantac.

For past year I couldn&#039;t tolerate more than 100 mg of W. w/o terrible fatigue.   A year later I just got up to 150 mg without fatigue... no relief of depression yet.  Also in therapy.

Cons:  severe initial 7-10 days side effects.  Still experiencing severe dehydration, dry mouth, nausea, dead libido, moody, increase in tobacco smoking, loss of appetite.  Fantastic benefits.

That being said, it takes about 3 weeks to kick in fully. It also makes me dizzy if I take it differently than normal (with food as opposed to without, vice versa). It would also not be a good choice for someone with moderate to severe anxiety, as it is not a very strong drug.

L-lysine:
You can buy L-lysine over the counter in tablet form, one a day pretty much prevents cold sores from forming. 
If you run out of tablets make sure you buy more; it&#039;s like the virus sits inactive under the skin just waiting for a break from the L-lysine treatment so it can raise it&#039;s ugly head. 
ZOVIRAX:
If you feel a cold sore coming on or you have a cold sore buy Zovirax from the chemist or supermarket ~$17 a tube; but you only need a little bit applied 5 or 6 times a day and the last application should be before you go to sleep (whenever you think of applying it really) Zovirax helps heal the blisters much faster than anything else l have tried.
ICE OR COLD PACK:
If you don&#039;t have Zovirax and the cold sore is really burning and itchy get a freezer bag or similar and put some ice in it or some frozen peas and apply that to the area until that nasty burning and itchy feeling eases.
Avoid licking of playing with the blisters with your tongue, this tends to make them bigger.
Pop the Blisters or Don&#039;t Pop the Blisters? This is a personal preference however, 
l have found that by not popping the blisters only allows the blisters to grow bigger to the point of them sometimes joining together and becoming one big blister which takes a lot longer to heal, hence, l pop the blister and apply Zovirax straight away and the majority are gone within a few days.
SAFETY FIRST:
DO NOT have oral sex and AVOID kissing anyone when you have an active cold sore; they do spread as quickly as a peck on the lips from someone with the active cold sore virus and wash your hands if you touch your mouth by accident, this helps prevent spreading the cold sore virus.
PREVENTION:
Take L-lysine 1 tablet daily and try to avoid sudden drops in temperature, excessive sun or wind. Changes in climate conditions and temperature drops can bring on the cold sore virus.
Avoid rubbing your lips hard like we sometimes do to remove stubborn lipstick and avoid the hard bristles of a man&#039;s beard or regrowth, both of these things can irritate the sensitive skin on our lips.
Just be mindful of the cold sore virus and it will become second nature to prevent it from occurring.""",10,20-Mar-17,9

I ended up experiencing my normal ovulation symptoms as well, which made me even more worried as this pill is supposed to prevent ovulation. I didn&#039;t experience any side effects (no headaches, nausea, etc), but I did have some cramping that began about four days after I took it, and continued off and on for about a week. My period ended up coming today, which is three days before I expected it. Give it time and try not to worry!""",10,3-Oct-17,2
10,135817,69494,Buprenorphine,Opiate Dependence,"""I had a very good experience on this medication from opiate dependency, it actually helped me get off opiates better than most other &quot;treatments&quot;. I was prescribed Subutex (because I have hep C from injecting) instead of Suboxone. I never once tried to inject it or take it any other way than sublingual, I had no desire too. It worked wonders with me up until they switched me from Subutex to Suboxone. Well apparently they changed the law where I live, and only pregnant women or breast feeding women can remain on it, unless of course your allergic to Suboxone. I&#039;ve been having a horrible time with the Suboxone, headaches, stomach aches, and it doesn&#039;t work as well. I wish they never passed that law.""",10,13-Jul-15,10

From age 12 I had 9-10 day irregular, extremely heavy cycles. My cramps were so bad that I couldn&#039;t get out of bed &amp; would start vomiting, &amp; my acne was out of control. Once I turned 15 my mother suggested birth control. The first month was rough; I started the pack the day after my period ended &amp; a week later had another full period. The next month was a drastic change - my period was 4 days, NO cramps &amp; my skin has looked amazing ever since! Went from taking muscle relaxers for pain to an occasional Advil every few MONTHS! My insurance is great - 3 months for $22! That&#039;s less than $7.50/month! Sadly no increase in breast size, but no weight gain, either!""",10,16-Oct-12,32

Most of them gathered on my right cheek. I literally became a hermit for months and months because my self esteem was at an all time low. I could feel people staring at them during conversations. 

My dermatologist put me on two separate antibiotics and both seemed to actually make my skin worse. At my most recent visit, my dermatologist put me on Bactrim. We both talked about how I will have to get on accutane if this didn&#039;t work. 

After a week of taking Bactrim, my skin is completely clear (minus the scarring). I couldn&#039;t be more pleased. Finally feeling like myself again. :)""",10,14-Sep-17,8
10,98604,146236,Suboxone,Opiate Dependence,"""I was born an addict. I remember drinking at 8 years old. Oh I would go years staying clean, but on the inside I was craving drugs everyday. I have used almost every drug there is. I have a husband that is in the Army and 4 beautiful kids. I had a serious obsession with pain pills. I would take anything I could get my hands on. I wanted to die, the withdrawals were enough to keep me using to feel normal. I was about to lose everything. Finally I went to a doctor and was put on Suboxone, that was over two years ago. I am still clean, and do believe Suboxone is a miracle pill. Life is still hard, we still have struggles, but the Suboxone changed my life. Now I get to enjoy my children. I want to stay clean for them and me.""",10,25-Jun-10,27

For me there are no side effects, it just works. I suffered from depression due to the wide spread pain in my body but the Norco also has helped with that. I&#039;ve taken it for 4 years and have had times off of the medication and it&#039;s tough but only because the pain returns and I become sleep deprived. It really is a miracle.""",10,21-Nov-11,37

Now my cd4 is up to 340 from 280 and my viral load is down to 40. Getting off of sustiva was the best decision I ever made. No more side effects and no more worrying about eating and taking med.

It can and should be prescribed for use in domestic detox (UK regulations). A colleague prescribed this for me when I my symptoms worsened an I went home and spent four days thinking about my life. This medicine will save lives during detox, but you have to make it on your own from there. Plan your detox! Buy the right fresh food and vegetables. Take Vitamin B supplements to protect the brain. Tell the people you love about your problem, get them involved, stay away from other alcohol users and alcohol. One day at a time!

I think I&#039;ve found the right method that works for me and my body. I was nervous about it because I still have not found anything wrong. This might just be the one! I was on the pill before and I definitely felt the side effects...I was hungry all the time, breakouts, moodiness and depression...and weight gain. With the Nuva ring my weight has been stable (I did start a workout/diet plan so this may be the reason why I haven&#039;t gained any weight. No moodiness, no nausea, no headaches. I don&#039;t feel it during sex neither does my partner. Very easy process. The only thing I&#039;ve noticed is that my libido has decreased significantly!""",10,25-Apr-16,8

I was given it intravenously immediately after surgery, first for a hernia and second for a cat bite that had resulted in a septic joint. My partner will not take it because it made her feel nauseous. I have no nausea. 
Interestingly, morphene had no effect on me despite being supposedly the more effective medication for pain. The lesson is that different people&#039;s bodies respond differently.""",10,20-Aug-17,11

I have been frightened out of my wits for years at having a colonoscopy because I have heard all the horror stories. I chose Suprep as it came recommended from a friend. I prepared myself fully...I went on a low-residue diet one week before and I bought Smart Water and drank 2 liters during the day I started my prep to make sure I stayed fully hydrated. At 6:00 p.m. I drank my first 6 oz. in water...not bad. I got it down in 5 large drinks. I waited 40 minutes and then I literally sat on the stool for the next 1-1/2 hours. I had NO GAS PAINS, NO NAUSEA. Nothing!!! I have a very sensitive stomach and was very concerned about getting sick. I set my alarm for 3:00 a.m. and drank my second dose. I sat on the stool for 2 hours until it was time to drive to the hospital. My experience was fantastic. I would rather take this for my chronic constipation than Dulcolax any day of the week.

I never had cramps or mood swings - but my periods were extremely irregular and would arrive unexpectedly to ruin my favorite pairs of underwear. My doctor selected this initially due to cost, as I was not sexually active and just wanted regulation. Now at age 24, I&#039;m happy to report it&#039;s effectiveness at preventing pregnancy, as well as a complete lack of any side effects.
